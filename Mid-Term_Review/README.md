This exam contains questions about an NCAA Mens basketball dataset. 
The dataset can be downloaded from the links below. Please note that 
you may be able to find some of the answers by searching the internet. 
In some instances I have changed this data so that information from this 
dataset does not reflect real life. So if you use the internet to search
for the answers rather than using the data supplied you do so at your own risk. 

The primary data can be found in the RegularSeasonHistory table. In this table
each row represents an outcome of a game for a team. Because each game results 
in 1 team winning and 1 team losing, there are 2 rows for each game in the dataset.
