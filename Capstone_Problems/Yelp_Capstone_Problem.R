#capstone problem 1

# Using the Yelp review data, find the 5 businesses with the largest downward trend in reviews. 
# Plot the businesses average review over time in a faceted plot. 
# Select your own colors for the businesses plots using a manual color selection with hex values 
# you gather from googles color picking tool.  


# We will define "downward trend" as the business whos median change in month-over-month average reviews is lowest.
# You should ignore any month for any business in which there were less than 30 reviews
# you should ignore any business that does not have 5 or more valid months
# once you have identified the 5 businesses be sure to include all of the data in your subsequent analysis



# make a faceted barplot that shows the monthly average reviews over time for each business. each business should appear in its own facet.
# give the business name at the top of each facet. Select a unique color for each business. Label each bar with
# the number of reviews in that month.
